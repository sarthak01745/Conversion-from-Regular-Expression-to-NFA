# Conversion-from-Regular-Expression-to-NFA
# EXP-2: Regular Expression to NFA

## Aim
To convert a given regular expression into its equivalent NFA.

## Algorithm
1. Convert regular expression to postfix form
2. Apply Thompson's construction
3. Generate NFA states and transitions

## Tools Used
- Python
- GitHub

## Result
The regular expression is successfully converted into an NFA.
